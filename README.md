# Disease-Diagnosis-System
This is a personalized diagnosis software that gets the symptoms from the users and suggests a list of diseases based on the given symptoms using various machine learning classification and regression models. These models have been trained and tested on UCI machine learning repository datasets. For each model, it computes the performance accuracy using different parameters such as cross validation folds. It also maintains various DB of users, hospitals, and diseases. Additionally, it provides a list of hospitals based on the budget and the locality of the user.
